# FeedThemMoney

I am building this app because I fail to track my finances. I have tried various tools to fulfil the need, but they have been just work arounds. So while rethinking the process from ground up and using a simple spreadsheet, I have figured a way to simply enter the transaction with a category. The category is bundled with Accounting Concepts such as Liabilities, Expenses, Income and Assets. Based on the bundle, the values are aggregated and actual account health is displayed. I can also set a estimated budget for each category which gives a comparision on current standing. So now i can clearly see what my position is and then I can plan financial decisions accordingly.

I have taken a database first approach for this project. So, the application can work without a front-end using DBMS tools such as PHPMyAdmin or MySQLWorkbench or Custom tool that you use. The files are located in the Database Folder

I am designing a front-end as per my needs in the Application Folder using Next Js.
